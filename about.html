            <p id="About">
                <strong>School:</strong> Before college I attended <strong>Cheshire High School</strong> (CHS) in Cheshire, Connecticut.
                At CHS I was a member of the Latin Club and was the captain of the men's track team. In 2016, I graduated with an honor cord in career and 
                technical education. Currently I attend <strong>Worcester Polytechnic Institute</strong> (WPI) in Worcester,
                Massachusetts. I am working towards receiving a bachelor's degree in Computer Science with a minor in Interactive Media and Game Development.
                I also have taken several humanities classes with a focus on art and digital imaging. On campus I am a member of Beta Theta Pi, participate in several
                intramural sports leagues, and will ocassionally attend meetings at WPI's popular Cheese Club.

                <strong>Hobbies and Interests:</strong> Ever since coming to college I have fallen in love with <strong>programming</strong>.
                My high school did not offer much oppurtunity for learning to code, however during my time in college, programming
                has become one of my favorite hobbies. I also enjoy playing and watching <strong>sports</strong>. In high school
                I ran track and was the captain of my team. I am a huge fan of the Cincinnati Bengals and the Orlando Magic (despite 
                living in Massachusetts). At WPI, I am a brother of the Eta Tau chapter of <strong>Beta Theta Pi</strong>. Beta is
                a group of brothers who strive to push each other to become better men by following the character values of Mutual Assistance,
                Intellectual Growth, Trust, Responsible Conduct, and Integrity. Lastly, to destress from school and work I enjoy playing 
                <strong>video games</strong>. Ever since I was a kid I have loved everything about video games and have been interested in how they work,
                as well as the game development process. Because of this interest, I am working towards receiving a game development minor in my studies.

                <strong>Interactive Qualifying Project:</strong> In the fall of my junior year I traveled abroad to  
                Switzerland for a term to work on an Interactive Qualifying Project (IQP). An IQP is a group based research project hosted by WPI. The goal
                of my project was to improve accessibility for visitors at the Grabser M&#252hlbach, a privately owned outdoor museum
                located in Grabs. Our final deliverable for the project was a manual with a list of recommendations for the Grabser M&#252hlbach 
                Association on several improvements they could make. Some of these changes include: adding QR Codes to easily access 
                information, redesigning their website, improved navigation with Google MyMaps integration, as well as more. The image
                to the right shows our final presentation to the association of our findings and ideas. As well as the manual and presentation, we also
                wrote a report on our project. Our final report can be viewed <a href="https://web.wpi.edu/Pubs/E-project/Available/E-project-101018-171850/" target="_blank">here</a>.
