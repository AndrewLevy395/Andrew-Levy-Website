           <p id="About">
               <strong>School:</strong> Before college I attended <strong>Cheshire High School</strong> (CHS) in Cheshire, Connecticut.
               At CHS I was a member of the Latin Club and was the captain of the men's track team. I graduated with a x.xx GPA and a 
               graduation honor in career and tech ed. Currently I attend <strong>Worcester Polytechnic Institute</strong> (WPI) in Worcester,
               Massachusetts. I am currently working towards majoring in Computer Science and minoring in Interactive Media and Game Development.
               I also have taken several humanities classes with a focus on art and digital imaging. On campus I am a member of Beta Theta Pi
               and the Cheese Club.

               <strong>Hobbies:</strong> Ever since coming to college I have fallen in love with <strong>programming</strong>.
               My high school did not offer much oppurtunity for learning to code, however since being in college programming
               has become one of my favorite hobbies. I also enjoy playing and watching <strong>sports</strong>. In high school
               I ran track and was the captain of my team. I am a huge fan of the Cincinnati Bengals and the Orlando Magic (despite 
               living in Massachusetts). At WPI, I am a brother of the Eta Tau chapter of <strong>Beta Theta Pi</strong>. Beta is
               a group of brothers who strive to push each other to become better men by following the character values of Mutual Assistance,
               Intellectual Growth, Trust, Responsible Conduct, and Integrity. Lastly, to destress from school work I enjoy playing 
               <strong>video games</strong>. Ever since I was a kid I have loved video games and have been interested in how they work
               and the game development process. Due to this, I am working towards getting an game development minor in my studies.

               <strong>Interactive Qualifying Project:</strong> In the fall of my junior year I traveled abroad to  
               Switzerland for a term to work on an Interactive Qualifying Project (IQP). An IQP is a group based research project hosted by WPI. The goal
               of my project was to improve accessibility at the Grabser Muhlb&#228ch, a privately owned outdoor museum
               located in Grabs. Our final deliverable for the project was a manual with a list of recommendations that the Grabser Muhlb&#228ch 
               Association on several improvements they could make. Some of these changes include: adding QR Codes to easily access 
               information, redesigning their website, improved navigation with Google MyMaps integration, as well as more. The image
               to the right shows our final presentation to the association of our findings and ideas. As well as the manual and presentation, we also
               wrote a report on our project. Our final report can be viewed <a href="https://web.wpi.edu/Pubs/E-project/Available/E-project-101018-171850/" target="_blank">here</a>.
