                    <strong>Interactive Qualifying Project:</strong> In the fall of my junior year I traveled abroad to  
                    Switzerland for a term to work on an Interactive Qualifying Project (IQP). An IQP is a group based research project hosted by WPI. The goal
                    of my project was to improve accessibility for visitors at the Grabser M&#252hlbach, a privately owned outdoor museum
                    located in Grabs. Our final deliverable for the project was a manual with a list of recommendations for the Grabser M&#252hlbach 
                    Association on several improvements they could make. Some of these changes include: adding QR Codes to easily access 
                    information, redesigning their website, improved navigation with Google MyMaps integration, as well as more. The image
                    to the right shows our final presentation to the association of our findings and ideas. As well as the manual and presentation, we also
                    wrote a report on our project. Our final report can be viewed <a href="https://web.wpi.edu/Pubs/E-project/Available/E-project-101018-171850/" target="_blank">here</a>.

                    <strong>Algol Meeting Scheduler:</strong> In a Software Engineering Course at WPI (CS3733) I worked with a team of four members to create an
                    online meeting scheduler website. On this site, users can create a meeting and invite particpants via URL to schedule meetings in timeslots.
                    The dates and times of these timeslots can be decided by the schedule organizer prior to creating the schedule and then can be extended later.
                    When creating a schedule, the organizer is given a secret code, which they can use to access and edit their schedule at a later time.
                    The program also has administrative properties to allow our group to remove any schedules that are unused within however many days we choose.
                    The schedules were stored in a mySQL database and the front-end was written in Google's Angular framework, using Google's material design priciples.
                    You can view the Algol Meeting Scheduler at <a href="https://cs3733.com/" target="_blank">CS3733.com</a> 
                    or view the completed code <a href="https://github.com/AndrewLevy395/CS-3733-Algol" target="_blank">here</a>.
