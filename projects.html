        <strong>Algol Meeting Scheduler:</strong> In a Software Engineering
        Course at WPI (CS3733) I worked with a team of four members to create an
        online meeting scheduler website. On this site, users can create a
        meeting and invite particpants via URL to schedule meetings in
        timeslots. The dates and times of these timeslots can be decided by the
        schedule organizer prior to creating the schedule and then can be
        extended later. When creating a schedule, the organizer is given a
        secret code, which they can use to access and edit their schedule at a
        later time. The program also has administrative properties to allow our
        group to remove any schedules that are unused within however many days
        we choose. The schedules were stored in a mySQL database and the
        front-end was written in Google's Angular framework, using Google's
        material design priciples. You can view the completed code for the Algol
        Meeting Scheduler

        <br /><strong>Codenames:</strong> In a Webware course during my senior
        year of WPI, I worked with a group of three to create an online version
        of the popular card game Codenames. The rules on how to play the game
        can be found

          target="_blank"
          >here</a
        >. Using JavaScript's Socket.io and Socket.io-client libraries we were
        able to create an application that communicates with a Node.js server,
        and updates client real-time. This was mainly used for implementing a
        constant game state (and storing that information on the server), as
        well as updating player's turn order. The front-end was written in the
        React framework, which allowed us to modify specific React components in
        real-time so that users can interact live while playing the game. The
        completed code of our final project can be viewed

        <strong>Interactive Qualifying Project:</strong> In the fall of my
        junior year I traveled abroad to Switzerland for a term to work on an
        Interactive Qualifying Project (IQP). An IQP is a group based research
        project hosted by WPI. The goal of my project was to improve
        accessibility for visitors at the Grabser Muhlbach, a privately owned
        outdoor museum located in Grabs. Our final deliverable for the project
        was a manual with a list of recommendations for the Grabser Muhlbach
        Association on several improvements they could make. Some of these
        changes include: adding QR Codes to easily access information,
        redesigning their website, improved navigation with Google MyMaps
        integration, as well as more. The image to the right shows our final
        presentation to the association of our findings and ideas. As well as
        the manual and presentation, we also wrote a report on our project. Our
        final report can be viewed
