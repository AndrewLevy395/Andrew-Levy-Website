           <p id="About">Hello! My name is <strong>Andrew Levy</strong> and I am a Junior at Worcester 
               Polytechnic Institute in Worcester, Massachusetts. I am currently majoring in computer 
               science and minoring in interactive media and game design.

               <strong>Hobbies:</strong> Ever since coming to college I have fallen in love with <strong>programming</strong>.
               My high school did not offer much oppurtunity for learning to code, however since being in college programming
               has become one of my favorite hobbies. I also enjoy playing and watching <strong>sports</strong>. In high school
               I ran track and was the captain of my team. I am a huge fan of the Cincinnati Bengals and the Orlando Magic (despite 
               living in Massachusetts. At WPI, I am a brother of the Eta Tau chapter of <strong>Beta Theta Pi</strong>. Beta is
               a group of brothers who strive to push each other to become better men by following the character values of Mutual Assistance,
               Intellectual Growth, Trust, Responsible Conduct, and Integrity. Lastly, to destress from school work I enjoy playing 
               <strong>video games</strong>. Ever since I was a kid I have loved video games and have been interested in how they work
               and the game development process. Due to this, I am working towards getting an IMGD minor in my studies.
